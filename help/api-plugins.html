In Views, a plugin is a bit like a handler, but plugins are not directly responsible for building the query. Instead, they are objects that are used to display the view or make other modifications.

There are 5 types of plugins in Views:
<dl>
<dt>display</dt>
<dd>Display plugins are responsible for controlling <strong>where</strong> a view lives. Page and block are the most common displays, as well as the ubiquitous 'default' display which is likely what will be embedded.</dt>
<dt>style</dt>
<dd>Style plugins control how a view is displayed. For the most part they are object wrappers around theme templates.
