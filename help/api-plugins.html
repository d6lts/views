In Views, a plugin is a bit like a handler, but plugins are not directly responsible for building the query. Instead, they are objects that are used to display the view or make other modifications.

There are 5 types of plugins in Views:
<dl>
<dt>Display</dt>
<dd>Display plugins are responsible for controlling <strong>where</strong> a view lives. Page and block are the most common displays, as well as the ubiquitous 'default' display which is likely what will be embedded.</dd>
<dt>Style</dt>
<dd>Style plugins control how a view is displayed. For the most part they are object wrappers around theme templates.
<dt>Row style</dt>
<dd>Row styles handle each individual record from a node.</dd>
<dt>Argument default</dt>
<dd>Argument default plugins allow pluggable ways of providing arguments for blocks. Views includes plugins to extract node and user IDs from the URL; additional plugins could be used for a wide variety of tasks.</dd>
<dt>Argument validator</dt>
<dd>Validator plugins can ensure arguments are valid, and even do transformations on the arguments.</dd>
</dl>
