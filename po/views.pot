msgid "The views module allows administrators and site designers to create, manage, and display lists of content. Each list managed by the views module is known as a \"view\", and the output of a view is known as a \"display\". Displays are provided in either block or page form, and a single view may have multiple displays. Optional navigation aids, including a system path and menu item, can be set for each page-based display of a view. By default, views may be created that list content (a <em>Node</em> view type), content revisions (a <em>Node revisions</em> view type) or users (a <em>User</em> view type). A view may be restricted to members of specific user roles, and may be added, edited or deleted at the <a href=\"@views-administration\">views administration page</a>."
